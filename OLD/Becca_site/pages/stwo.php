                    This new construction, two level residence, is a home to a family of five. The 4,961 square feet residence needs to accommodate space for family gatherings and space for the children to grow. To suit the clients wishes, the house will be modernized with elements of nature throughout. The space will need to accommodate medium sized groups of family while also following form and function. In order to accomplish this need, built in furniture will be seen throughout the entire house.</p>

                    The clients requested a modern and nature inspired theme with the most used room being the living room. The family enjoys entertaining friends and family often, the kitchen being the vessel of entertainment. This will come into play through the use of a large dining space connected off of the kitchen as well as a large kitchen that has plenty of room for friends and family to visit with one another. The family is in need of four bedrooms, including the master bedroom, three full baths and two powder rooms. They requested a theater room, as the family enjoys watching movies together often. The parents also have a wine and bourbon collection that they would like to showcase.</p>
