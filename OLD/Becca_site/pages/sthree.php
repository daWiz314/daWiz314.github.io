                <p>The special feature used in this design is arts and crafts inspired. The residents desired a modern house with nature incorporated, which is exactly why this build will be completed in a modernized arts and crafts style. The arts and crafts style is a broader social movement that encompasses not just architecture, but also interior design, textiles, fine art, and more. The design movement began as a revolt against the opulence of the Industrial Revolution, where design could be unnecessarily overdone. Arts and crafts style was created to emphasize human craftsmanship and the connection of everyday objects with the natural world. The movement rejected the rise of classical and Gothic revivalism that came with growing industrialism in the United Kingdom.</p>

                <p>Instead, the movement emphasized organic, primitive designs that commonly featured stylized botanical subjects, birds, and other animal motifs. Natural materials were used throughout, with the patinated luster of wood, brickwork, and stucco playing a significant part in the Arts and Crafts aesthetic. Designers like Augustus Pugin and William Morris felt that contemporary architectural and design trends were overly ornate and poorly made. Pugin and Morris each inspired local artisans like themselves to embrace simplicity, functionality, and the aesthetics of common life in their work. Morris encouraged people to “have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.” As the world entered the first World War, and as industrialism, machinery, and mass production became increasingly common, the Arts and Crafts Movement began to fade. By 1920, the movement had all but subsided; however, its impact would nonetheless be felt for many decades after, with many of the elements of the movement influencing future architects, including American architect Frank Llyod Wright and his Prairie School of design.</p>
